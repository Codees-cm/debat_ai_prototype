// "Sarah Johnson is a homeowner in Springfield, who, in March 2022, entered into a contract with GreenTech Innovations, Inc., a company specializing in sustainable construction materials.

The contract stipulated a completion date of June 1, 2022, and included specific performance guarantees regarding the roof's longevity and energy savings.",
//     defendant: "As of September 2022, the roof had not been installed, and Johnson had incurred additional costs for temporary repairs and increased energy bills due to the inadequacies of her existing roof. Frustrated with the delays and communication issues, Johnson filed a complaint, seeking damages for breach of contract, misrepresentation regarding the product's quality and performance, and emotional distress caused by the prolonged uncertainty and financial strain.",
